## Abstract
LiDAR mapping is important yet challenging in self-driving and mobile robotics. To tackle such a global point cloud registration problem, DeepMapping converts the complex map estimation into a self-supervised training of simple deep networks. Despite its broad convergence range on small datasets, DeepMapping still cannot produce satisfactory results on large-scale datasets with thousands of frames. This is due to the lack of loop closures and exact cross-frame point correspondences, and the slow convergence of its global localization network. We propose DeepMapping2 by adding two novel techniques to address these issues: (1) organization of training batch based on map topology from loop closing, and (2) self-supervised local-to-global point consistency loss leveraging pairwise registration. Our experiments and ablation studies on public datasets (KITTI, NCLT, and Nebula) demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Our code will be released.


# Getting Started:
## Installation
The code is tested with Python 3.9, PyTorch 1.13.1, and CUDA 11.6.

To install the dependencies, you can create a virtual environment with
```
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

## Data Preparation
To download the dataset used for training and testing, please refer to [./data/README.md](./data/README.md)

## Usage
To train the model, execute the script
```
cd script/
./run_train.sh
```
The visualization and evaluation results will be saved in the `results` folder.

To use a different initial pose and pairwise registration, please edit `INIT` and `PAIRWISE` in the script to direct to the corresponding files.
